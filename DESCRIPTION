Description: Evaluate a bulk of csv files in one directory, produced by Purency. 
    It will count occurrences of of fibres, fragments, spheres and pixels, as well as size fractions 
    (<10, 10-20, 20-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150-200,..., >500) for each polymer. Each 
    file (i.e., each measurement) is evaluated separately, as well as summarized 
    for all files (i.e., one sample). For each sample a new excel file will be generated
    in the folder where the files are placed.
