Description: Evaluate a bulk of *.csv files in one directory, produced by particle analyses software (such as MicroplasticFinder, 
    siMPle or MicroparticleAI). 
    It will count occurrences of of fibres, fragments, spheres and pixels, as well as (customisable 
    size fractions for each polymer. Each 
    file (i.e., each measurement) is evaluated separately, as well as summarized 
    for all files (i.e., one sample). Also the blank correction is done during the processing.
    For each sample a new excel file will be generated
    in the folder where the files are placed. The function is highly customisable and each 
    parameter can be changed to your desire.
